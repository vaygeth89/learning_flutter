### Flutter Setup
1. Download [Flutter SDK](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install?gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwhvi0BhA4EiwAX25uj4kr82tpWlPrD_UnvrK0y3MLhzP7T8znLtcK1tQ4siKitQHDjO-uyxoC0dYQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds)
2. Follow the guide for each Operating System you are using to setup the SDK on your computer
3. Download your favourite code editor or IDE, usually [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio?gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwhvi0BhA4EiwAX25ujx2Ri3MhkziThJ-du00r5qgKQmXG84scE5lhpJ1ogIYhxFjxPqKxoRoCresQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) are used to develop Flutter
    * If you are using VSCode, then install the following extensions on VSCode
      * [Dart](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Dart-Code.dart-code) extension
      * [Flutter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Dart-Code.flutter) extension
4. Setup Android SDK (optional)
    * if you are going to develop and test on Android Emulator this is optional
    * You can download Android Studio, it will set Android SDK for you by default
5. If all previous steps completed, you may want to confirm there's no missing configuration using follow Flutter CLI, run using Powershell (on Windows) or Terminal (on Mac or Linux) (this won't work until you setup the Flutter SDK properly in Step 2)
   

```bash
flutter doctor
```
